        <h1>Understanding Tremp</h1>
        <p className="App-description">
          In Israel, the concept of 'Tremp' (תרמפ), derived from the English word 'tramp', 
          holds a unique cultural significance. Unlike the often negative connotations 
          associated with hitchhiking in many parts of the world, tremping is a widely 
          accepted and frequently practiced method of transportation in Israel. 
          This practice is particularly prevalent in areas where public transportation 
          is sparse, such as in the West Bank settlements or certain parts of the 
          Golan Heights and Galilee.
